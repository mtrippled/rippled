    Automatically unlocks and re-locks a mutex object.

    This is the reverse of a std::lock_guard object - instead of locking the mutex
    for the lifetime of this object, it unlocks it.

    Make sure you don't try to unlock mutexes that aren't actually locked!

    e.g. @code

    std::mutex mut;

    for (;;)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> myScopedLock{mut};
        // mut is now locked

        ... do some stuff with it locked ..

        while (xyz)
        {
            ... do some stuff with it locked ..

            GenericScopedUnlock<std::mutex> unlocker{mut};

            // mut is now unlocked for the remainder of this block,
            // and re-locked at the end.

            ...do some stuff with it unlocked ...
        }  // mut gets locked here.

    }  // mut gets unlocked here
    @endcode
